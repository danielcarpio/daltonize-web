# Daltonize-web

Daltonize-web takes a capture of a website and simulates the three 
types of dichromatic color blindness and images and matplotlib 
figures. Generalizing and omitting a lot of details these types are:

* Deuteranopia: green weakness
* Protanopia: red weakness
* Tritanopia: blue weakness (extremely rare)

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:danielcarpio/daltonize-web.git

Used libraries:

* numpy
* selenium
* matplotlib

Currently, only works with Chromium and Firefox, so you have to install at 
least one of them

This software only works on Linux


## Usage

As a command line tool:

```
$ daltonize.py

and follow the steps.
